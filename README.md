## Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard enables users to get current and 5-day weather forecasts by typing in the name of a city.

## How to Run the Project

Upon launching the website, the user is prompted to enter a city name. Once they've done so and pressed the Search key, the current temp will be displayed predominantly while the 5-Day forecast will appear beneath it. If the user wants to choose a different city, they can do so by re-entering that city while the city they chose previously will be displayed beneath the entry field.
